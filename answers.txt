 What has changed? What do you think the > in the previous statement did when combined with the ls command?:
 When you type the ls command again a new file has been added called newfile.txt. I think the > in the command was saying to list all available directories into newfile.txt
 
 
 What does it say about newfile.txt? Git Status:
Git status tells me the tracked an untracked files and also tells me which files will be commited and which files will not be commited.


 Now run the command git diff. What does this command tell you about your files and their contents?:
 This tells me the index but it also tells me that the line I had just typed was added to the contents of newfile.txt
